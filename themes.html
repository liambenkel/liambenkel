<h2>Part 1: Themes</h2>
<dl>
    <dt>Difference in Categorizing</dt>
        <dd>One thing I noticed when looking over other people's media breakdowns was while we had
            media in come it was under a different category. For example, in <a href="https://media-page-ten.vercel.app/">Evan Buriols </a>
            website they list instagram as a video platform while I put it under social media. This shows how even though we have media incommon,
            we consume it in a different way as various platforms offer a variety of different platforms. In <a href="https://kimberlykchen.wixsite.com/kimchencsce445">Kimberly Chen's</a>
            she also has instagram listed, but has it listed as a post format, while I orginally had it as just a form of social media.
        </dd>
    <dt>Too Much Content and Algorithms</dt>
        <dd>When looking over other people's challenges with media, I noticed a common trend of people being fed
            media they do not care for. In <a href="https://csce-445-bucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Project1-Webpage/index.html">Connor Fergus's </a>
            case, whenever it comes to trying to find his prefered content on youtube he is fed videos that are popular or trending that don't have any correlation
            to his search. Another example of there being too much content is with <a href="https://people.tamu.edu/~kdaoq2819/">Khao Dao's</a> page describing
            how it's is hard to find the content you want to consume or overall prefer.
        </dd>
    <dt>Why Students Take this Course</dt>
        <dd>One of the more common things I noticed through most people's websites was the reason why they are taking this course. <a href="https://przalan12.github.io/">Alan Perez </a>
            , is taking this course to learn more the transformation of media can be further explored. Likewise, <a href="https://people.tamu.edu/~bellawoliver/csce445/home.html">Bella Woliver </a>
            wants to learn more about how media contributes to today's culuture. Our motives are centered around better understanding the impact of media on our lives.</dd>

<h2>Part 2: Improvements</h2>
<body>After reviewing other student's media categories, I realized I made my diagram at a very high level. In areas such as social media, I
    could have been more descriptive in how I use certain features of said social media. If I were to add to my hierarchy of media, I would 
    want to include the various devices I consume media on. I feel like the devices I use are a really important factor in how I consume my media.
    Some challenges I did not identify in the first assignment were security concerns. I feel like with media today there are many attempts at
    stealing data and I should be more cautious.
